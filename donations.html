<style2>DARTMOUTH COLLEGE ALUMNI FUND</style2>
<br>
Along with the history and tradition of excellence that is Dartmouth comes a strong legacy of generosity. Students on campus today benefit from the support of alumni who came before them, just as part of your Dartmouth experience was supported by those before you. This tradition continues through the Fund as alumni provide today's talented students with the tools and resources they need to realize opportunities that may otherwise pass them by. Your investment in their future affords you a chance to connect with current students. Your gift makes you a part of their successes as you strengthen Dartmouth's influence for the benefit of generations to come. You may make a pledge or donation via Internet, phone, or mail. For further information, please visit the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~alfund/" target="_blank">Dartmouth College Fund</a> website, call the Dartmouth College Alumni Fund at 1-800-228-1769, or e-mail

<style2>THE ENDOWMENT</style2>
<br>
Dartmouth welcomes large financial gifts in which the donor's intent is to preserve the principal in perpetuity and spend the income only. Gifts may be unrestricted or restricted in its use, as specified by the donor. The College, however, encourages gifts in which the donor does not restrict the purpose of the endowment, but rather states a preference for the purpose. The minimum amount required to establish a named endowment fund is $10,000.
<br>
<br>
The College prefers that gifts used to establish endowment funds be in the form of cash or marketable securities. Sometimes donors wish to contribute other forms of gifts, such as real estate, bequests and trusts, equipment and other tangible property, and patents, copyrights, etc. Acceptance of these gifts must have prior review by appropriate College officials and/or departments.
<br>
<br>
The donor can also specify gifts to three other distinct fund groups that the College maintains on its general ledger aside from endowments: current funds, loan funds, and plant funds.
<br>
