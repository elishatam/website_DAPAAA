That time of year has arrived and the Admissions Office can use your help, be it through conducting interviews or attending one of the receptions. More APA representation not only adds to the dialogue, but also speaks to the increasingly diverse student and alumni body. If you are interested in becoming an Alum Interviewer, please email <a href="mailto: admissions@dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth Admissions</a>. If there are other ways you would like help or if you have other questions, please email our Admissions Chair,
