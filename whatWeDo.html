    In the past few years, DAPAAA has:
    <ul>
        <li>Held a "lunch and learn" series where older alums in different fields lunched with younger alums who wanted to learn more about a specific field or occupation.
        <li>Organized brunches, happy hours, readings by professors, museum gatherings and our 10-year anniversary banquet, which attracted over 200 attendees and featured alumni performers and speakers from each decade since the 1970's.
        <li>Interviewed prospective applicants for Dartmouth Admissions, represented Dartmouth at College Fairs locally, and volunteered with APEX (an organization that works with Asian/Asian American youth applying to college).
        <li>Made our voices heard in the Budget reassessment process through the Alumni Council and DAPAAA Board/Membership issued statements to the President and Dean of the College.
